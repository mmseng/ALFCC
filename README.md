# Summary
A rudimentary PowerShell module for helping to identify value-level conflicts between No Man's Sky Mods.  

This is intended to be used along with AMUMSS. AMUMSS will identify file-level conflicts between mods, and will output a report of those conflicts to a `REPORT.lua` file. `Get-AmumssValueConflicts` can then be used to read `REPORT.lua`, drill down into the conflicting files, and identify the specific value conflicts within those files.
